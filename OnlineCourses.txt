Introduction to Bioinformatics (for the first rotation particularly non biologists):
  Life sciences in your computer:    https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinform
    LLP- Ideal for those from a non-biology background to get to grips with the first rotation in genetics. 
  Bioinformatic methods I&II:   https://class.coursera.org/bioinfomethods1-001
    LLP- Same as above and covers similar topics. Good for general background.

Introductory level Python courses:
  codecademy python :    https://www.codecademy.com/learn
    LLP- Good intro to the syntax of python. You  get through the course fairly quickly. Composed of small, guided, exercises
  Python for everybody:    https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python
    LLP- Very clearly explained programming principles. Useful to get to grips with python quickly.
  
Introduction to Computer Science:
  Introduction to computer science and programming using python :    https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-5
  Introduction to computational thinking and data science:  https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-6-00-2x-introduction-computational-2836#.VAhBKsV3Vc0
    LLP- Both these courses are excellent, fast paced, introduction to CS. Good assignments that really reinforce learning.
  Introduction to computer science CS50 :    https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x
    LLP- Really good, fun, overview of computer science. Excellent explanations of principles. 

Algorithms:
  Rosalind:   www.rosalind.info
    LLP- wonderful set of programs to work through slowly. Helpful to do concurrently with any of the learning to program courses as it helps highlight the uses of programming in a biological context.
  Bioinformatics Specialisation:  https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics
    LLP- wonderful course created by the same people as Rosalind. Can be made more or less challenging, online e-book is great. Can't recommend highly enough. 
Introduction to Genomics:
  Genomic data science:    https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomics?utm_medium=courseDescripTop
    LLP- Most courses in the specialisation are very simple, but would give first years a fairly good grounding on the basics
  
Statistics:
  Statistics and R for the life sciences: https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-r-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-1x#!
    LLP- An entire specialisation dealing with data analysis (with R).  First iteration was good, but assignments needed a bit more work (they were too guided), I hear new iterations are better.
