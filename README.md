# STPresources

This repository will hold a list of resources previous Bioinformatics (Genomics) STP trainees have found helpful.Feel free to add comments to any of the entries explaining whether you, too, have found it helpful or whether the resource is outdated, not that useful etc. Removing resources because you didn't find it helpful is not encouraged as someone else did find them useful (enough to bother typing it up!), but a note explaining why you didn't is. 

I've provisionally given a grading system for the courses according to how useful I found things:

+ok

++good

+++excellent

_neutral

-not useful

--really not useful/awful/etc...
