# STPresources

This repository will hold a list of resources previous Bioinformatics (Genomics) STP trainees have found helpful.Feel free to add comments to any of the entries explaining whether you, too, have found it helpful or whether the resource is outdated, not that useful etc. Removing resources because you didn't find it helpful is not encouraged, but a note explaining why you didn't is.
